      <title>The biggest problem with the funding formula for Children&#39;s Social Services isn&#39;t that it&#39;s too inequitable, it&#39;s that it&#39;s too relative.</title>

In 2018, Paul Bywaters and I published a paper about the funding of children’s services under the austerity years of the coalition government (open access repository version here). The headline finding from this research was that the term ‘decimated’ was a huge understatement for describing what had happened to funding for family support and early help between 2010 and 2015. Resources available to local authorities for providing these services could more accurately be described as having been obliterated, and that the cuts were far worse in the most deprived local authorities.</description>
