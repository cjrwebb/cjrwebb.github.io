## We know, however, the size of this social gradient differs in different contexts and for different populations. Through 2019-2020, we developed a way to measure the social gradient as a single number and compare whether it was significantly different in different contexts or with different populations.

The .green[social gradient] is a simple .green[measure of the size of socioeconomic inequalities in child welfare interventions].

The .green[social gradient] is a simple .green[measure of the size of socioeconomic inequalities in child welfare interventions]. You can think of it like a seesaw - .green[the stronger the social gradient is, the greater the vertical distance there is between the left and right sides of the seesaw]. 

In this case, the .green[left] of the seesaw represents .green[low deprivation neighbourhoods] and the .green[right] represents .green[high deprivation neighbourhoods] - with middle deprivation neighbourhoods in the middle. 

The steeper the incline of the seesaw, the more socioeconomic inequalities there are.

The .green[size of this incline or decline can be expressed in a single number] by measuring .green[how many times higher the height at the average deprivation level of the seesaw is than the height at the low-deprivation level of the seesaw].

On average, in neighbourhoods in a representative sample from England, the .green[size of the social gradient in children looked-after rates is 1.7].

On average, in neighbourhoods in a representative sample from England, the .green[size of the social gradient in children looked-after rates is 1.7]. 

This means that we estimate that there are, on average, 1.7 times higher children looked after rates in your average middle-deprivation neighbourhood than there are in your average low deprivation neighbourhood.

This is a valuable way of simplifying the social gradient, because .green[it holds for every comparison of the same 'distance' in deprivation]. 

For example, we would also expect the rates of children looked-after in your average high deprivation neighbourhood to be 1.7 times higher than the average middle deprivation neighbourhood.

We could extend even this further and would expect the rates in the most deprived 2.5% of neighbourhoods in the country to be 1.7 times higher than the rates of the high deprivation neighbourhood.

Our research has been .green[exploring how the social gradient changes depending on different contexts]. 

This includes by .green[ethnic group population], by .green[overall LA deprivation], and by LA .green[income inequality] (Webb, et al. 2020a; 2020b). These different social contexts significantly change the size of the social gradient.

The last slide I want to show in this level of granularity is about the .red['Mixed Heritage (Other)' child population].

Across the spectrum of deprivation, the 'Mixed Heritage (Other)' population has .red[significantly higher rates of being in care], and a .red[significant social gradient]. They face the sharp end of the racial inequalities and socioeconomic inequalities we see in child welfare interventions.

Mixed Heritage people are the .red[fastest growing ethnic population in the UK]. Yet our analyses rarely consider the inequalities they face - .red[they are often excluded] from analyses because the category is so broad.

# Consequences for Policy and Practice

--

* There is a .green[crisis in socioeconomic and racial justice regarding the children's social care system]; the scale of the socioeconomic and intersectional inequalities, especially when they compound with larger structural contexts, is enormous, not well recognised, and not well understood.

--

* The IILs show that the response to .green[addressing child welfare inequalities must include national government]. Local income inequality and overall local authority deprivation are often the consequences of national policies. This is especially important considering the devolution of government.

--

* The analyses show that .green[anti-racist and anti-poverty social work policies and practice risk being unproductive or counterproductive for achieving justice if not pursued through an intersectional approach].

--

* The .green[data infrastructure for children's services, and factors like local income inequality, is poor; especially relative to other countries]. This greatly limits the depth of intersections we can analyse and should be a priority.

Consequences for policy and practice: we need to approach a new understanding of mechanisms using an intersectional approach
