title: "Test: Embedded Shinyapp Tutorials"
description: |
  This test shows a format for embedded tutorials running on an external Shinyapps.io server that can execute `R` code and display output using the `learnr` package. Need to figure out how to add custom jQuery and html to load the exercises on click (to optimise server use).

`ggplot2` is an `R` package for creating graphs and plots using a 'grammar of graphics' approach. Graphs are built up in segments, starting with the data, followed by the selection of a geometric `geom_` object (e.g. are we plotting points, bars, lines), followed by aesthetic `aes()` mappings (which aesthetics of the graph do we want to change according to variable values in the data), followed by static themeing arguments.  

```{r, layout="l-page-outset"}
htmltools::HTML("<h3>Follow the exercises below to build up a basic <code>ggplot2</code> graph for a scatterplot.</h3>")
```


```{r, layout="l-page-outset"}

knitr::include_app("https://webb.shinyapps.io/ex_1/", height = 600)

```
