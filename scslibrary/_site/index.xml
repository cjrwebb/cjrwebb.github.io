      <title>Child Welfare Interventions at the Intersection of Ethnicity and Deprivation</title>
      <dc:creator>Calum Webb</dc:creator>
      <link>http://scslibrary.calumwebb.uk/posts/intersection-ethnicity-deprivation</link>
      <description>This resource explores the way that intervention rates in child populations differ according to deprivation and ethnicity. It introduces findings from the Child Welfare Inequalities Project that highlight that socioeconomic inequalities in child welfare interventions differ according to ethnicity. You will explore: What does ethnic disproportionality look like at a national level and in differently deprived neighbourhoods? How can you interpret ethnic disproportionality using incidence rate ratios? And how can this knowledge be used to think critically about challenging racism in children's services?</description>
